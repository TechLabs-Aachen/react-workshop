# React Workshop

Hi, welcome to the React Workshop! This should give you a good basic
understanding of React that will allow you to pretty much tackle any problem in
the frontend world.

First, I would advise you to have a look into [History of Frontend
Devlopment](./history-of-web/history.md) which will help you understand why
things are the way they are and why it will probably not stay that way.
