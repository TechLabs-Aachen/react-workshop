# React Workshop

Hi, welcome to the React Workshop! This should give you a good basic
understanding of React that will allow you to pretty much tackle any problem in
the frontend world.

First, I would advise you to have a look into [History of Frontend
Devlopment](./history-of-web/history.md) which will help you understand why
things are the way they are and why it will probably not stay that way.

Now, that you know the pain of front end development, we shall introduce the
basics of react, that is how to make simple *components*. For this checkout this
chapter about [React Components](./react-basics/components/components.md).
