# React Workshop

Hi, welcome to the React Workshop! This should give you a good basic theory
of React that will allow you to pretty much understand everything 
happening at our workshop. Maybe a few notes about theory: A theory is not
useful in some sense. It helps us to explain things we see and 
maybe predict some things. Newton could explain why an apple fell on his head
with his theory and predict bunch of really useful stuff BUT you cannot
build anything related to quantum mechanics using Newtons laws. (still
not a good example hm).

So yeah, this is a THEORY of React and thus you will NOT be able to build
anything useful with this. Or at least I do not expect to. We will show how to
make use of this theory in the workshop! It's is for you the be able to explain
the things that will happen.

## Guide

First, I would advise you to have a look into [History of Frontend
Devlopment](./history-of-web/history.md) which will help you understand why
things are the way they are and why it will probably not stay that way.

Now, that you know the pain of front end development, we shall introduce the
basics of react, that is how to make simple *components*. For this checkout this
chapter about [React Components](./react-basics/components/components.md).
